## Features

### 1. Google Firebase Authentication
Crown Clothing incorporates Google's Firebase Authentication system, allowing users to securely log in and register for an account. This provides a personalized shopping experience and ensures the security of user data.

### 2. Local Cart Persistence
The application features a custom local cart that persists even when users are not registered or logged in. This allows users to build and maintain a personalized cart experience without the need for an account.

### 3. Special Cart for Registered Users
Upon registration, users gain access to a special cart tied to their account. This personalized cart is designed to enhance the shopping experience for registered users without losing the contents of their local cart.

### 4. React.js and Redux
The frontend of Crown Clothing is developed using React.js, a powerful and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Redux is employed as a state management tool, ensuring a predictable state container for the application.

### 5. Redux-Saga for Asynchronous Operations
Redux-Saga is integrated to handle asynchronous operations such as data fetching, ensuring smooth user interactions and a responsive user interface.

### 6. Node.js and Express
The backend of the application is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a scalable and efficient server-side architecture. Express facilitates the handling of HTTP requests and serves as the foundation for the application's backend functionality.

### 7. Firebase and Firestore
Firebase is utilized for real-time data synchronization, authentication, and hosting. Firestore, a NoSQL database, is employed for efficient and scalable data storage, ensuring a smooth and performant user experience.
